Miny

A minesweeper clone.


FEATURES

 - Linux native
 - responsive on slow hardware
 - adjustable square size
 - timing in milliseconds
 - time, 3BV/s and IOE high scores, including non-flagging versions
 - recording and playing replays
 - to reveal squares around a numbered square with flagged adjacent mines you
   can click the square with any button
 - no "?" marks
 - pause


TO DO

 - set window class to use with some window managers
 - redisplay the field at the end of the game before writing replay (i.e.
   remove the delay)
 - prevent buffer overflows


COMPILING AND PLAYING

 To compile run 'make'. You'll need to have OpenGL libraries installed. On
 Ubuntu try the package freeglut3-dev.

 To play run './miny [options]'. For best results run from terminal.

 While playing, you can see how many effective / ineffective clicks you have
 made.


MOUSE AND KEYBOARD CONTROLS

 Apart from intuitive minesweeper mouse controls, these work:

 To start a new game press Space or click the yellow square or, when game has 
 ended, click anywhere outside the mine field.

 To pause/unpause while playing press P.

 To quit press Escape or Q.


OPTIONS

  Options with a question mark take a value.

  Game setup:

 -n?  player name
 -d?  difficulty - 1, 2 or 3 (1 - Beginner, 2 - Intermediate, 3 - Expert,
      4 - Beginner Classic) 
 -s?  square size in px (3 to 100, default=25)
 -m?  number of mines
 -w?  field width (2 to 100)
 -h?  field height (2 to 100)


  Score display:

 -t   list best times for the selected setup
 -3   list best 3BV/s for the selected setup
 -i   list best IOE-s for the selected setup


  Score filter:

 -f?  select scores by flagging (0 - all (default), 1 - flagging only, 
      2 - nf only)
 -g?  select scores by whether the game was won (0 - all, 1 - won only 
      (default), 2 - lost only) (using this option may produce buggy results)
 -l?  number of best scores to display (0 - all (default))


  Replay:

 -p?  play replay file. Value is a file name. This is usually of the format 
      x.replay where x is a number found in high score table.


NOTES
 
 Since version 0.5.0, the game stores scores in a new way, with more data 
 about played games. There currently isn't and probably won't be a tool to 
 convert old scores to the new system. If you don't want to keep them, you 
 can delete .hiscore (and whichever .replay you don't want) files from your 
 ~/.miny directory.


EXAMPLES

 ./miny -d3 -njoe -s35      # start game on expert difficulty, player name joe,
                            # square size 35

 ./miny -w10 -h10 -m10      # start game with the specified parameters

 ./miny -t                  # list best times for beg, int and exp combined

 ./miny -d2 -t              # list best times for intermediate

 ./miny -d2 -f2 -t          # list best times for intermediate, non-flagging 
                            # only

 ./miny -d1 -3              # list best 3BV/s for beginner

 ./miny -w10 -h10 -m10 -t   # list best times for games with the specified 
                            # parameters

 ./miny -p last.replay      # play replay for the last game played

 ./miny -p 4.replay         # play the selected replay
