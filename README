Miny

A minesweeper clone.

Features:

 - Linux native
 - responsive on slow hardware
 - high score logging in milliseconds and with the date and time high scores 
   were achieved
 - separate tables for flagging and non-flagging high scores
 - recording and playing replays
 - to reveal squares around a numbered square with flagged adjacent mines you
   can click the square with any button
 - adjustable square size
 - graphical interface
 - no "?" marks
 - pause


To do:

 - replay files assigned to high scores pushed out of high score tables are 
   being kept - maybe do something about it


Compiling and playing:

 To compile run 'make'. You'll need to have OpenGL libraries installed. On
 Ubuntu try the package freeglut3-dev.

 To play run './miny'. For best results run from terminal.


Mouse and keyboard controls:

 To start a new game press Space or, when game has ended, click anywhere 
 outside the mine field.

 To pause/unpause while playing press P.


Options:

 -d  difficulty - 1, 2 or 3 (1 - Beginner, 2 - Intermediate, 3 - Expert) 
     (default=2)
 -s  square size in px (default=25)
 -m  number of mines
 -w  field width
 -h  field height
 -n  player name
 -l  list high scores and exit
 -r  selects place in the high score table for current setup for which replay 
     will be played
 -f  play replay from non-flagging table (used with -r)
 -p  play replay file by name (works for replay files in ~/.miny)


Examples:

 ./miny -d3 -njoe           # start game on expert difficulty, player name joe

 ./miny -w10 -h10 -m10      # start game with the specified parameters

 ./miny -d2 -l              # list high scores and exit

 ./miny -d1 -r3             # play replay for the 3rd place in the beginner 
                            #   flagging high score table (add -f for 
                            #   non-flagging)

 ./miny -w10 -h10 -m10 -r1  # play replay for the 1st place in the selected
                            #   flagging high score table (add -f for 
                            #   non-flagging)

 ./miny -p last.replay      # play replay for the last game played
