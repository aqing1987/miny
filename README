Miny

A minesweeper clone.

Features:

 - Linux native
 - responsive on slow hardware
 - to reveal squares around a numbered square with flagged adjacent mines you
   can click the square with any button
 - reasonable (and adjustable) square size
 - graphical interface
 - (hopefully) actually runs
 - it's not necessary to flag all mines to win (you can play without flagging
   for example)
 - no "?" marks (I consider that a feature)
 - timing in milliseconds
 - high score logging
 - separate tables for flagging and non-flagging high scores
 - pause

To do:

 - fix how numbers look with nonstandard square sizes

        
To compile run 'make'. You'll need to have OpenGL libraries installed. On
Ubuntu try the package freeglut3-dev.

To play run './miny'. For best results run from terminal.

To start a new game when game has ended click anywhere outside the mine field,
or press Space at any other time.

To pause/unpause while playing press P.


Options:

 -d  difficulty - 1, 2 or 3 (1 - Beginner, 2 - Intermediate, 3 - Expert).
 -s  square size in px (default=25)
 -m  number of mines
 -w  field width
 -h  field height
 -n  player name
 -l  list high scores and exit


Examples:

 ./miny -d3 -njoe
 ./miny -w10 -h10 -m10
